			<h1>Semarang</h1>
            <p>This strategic position of Semarang has made the city a melting pot of Chinese, Indian Arab, and European cultures. Wander around the Chinese quarters and the Dutch commercial district, you will see the influences of different cultures everywhere. In the older part of the city near harbor named Kota Lama, or the Oudstadt, stroll around to explore the historic old buildings in what was once the European commercial district.
            Semarang city, the capital of Central Java province is located on the north Coast of Java Sea. Semarang is situated on Java's northern coast and is called the capital of Central Java, as it lies just about halfway between the extreme east and west coasts of the island. From Candi Hill we get amazing scenery of the port, the lowlands and green paddy fields, the city itself and the surrounding mountains. The environs around Semarang are perfect for clay trips side-excursions. Semarang is the five major cities in the nation. It is situated on Java's normally flat northern coast and appropriately called the capital of Central Java.</p>
